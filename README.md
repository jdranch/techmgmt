Jeff Technology Management Guide
Introduction
Hello ðŸ‘‹

From the time I contributed to my college's HTML 1.0 handbook and later when a senior UNIX administrator handed me a "helpful commands" guide, I have beeen compiling helpful and/or interesting commands, principles, laws, hueristics, quotes, and general tomfoolery that I have read and others have shared.

I hope you find these helpful and applicable to your journey
